### Machine Learning Model

In the ML-Folder you will find a machine learning model built to predict the probability of a user getting a stroke depending on the data provided. We have used a previous study that can be found ![here](https://github.com/nurahmadi/Stroke-prediction-with-ML) and decided to use XGBoost (XGB) Classifier.

The dataset we have used can be found ![here](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset). 11 Clinical features are selected to predict stroke events.
